Linear Algebra:

	-Which involves with linear equations, Vectors and Matrixes
	-Linear Equation: 
		The Equation with highest degree of 1.Also known as One degree equation

Vectors - Which as Magnitude and direction.
		Magnitude - Length
	  Example: Displacement, Velocity, acceleration, force, momentum.
		Displacement - distance with direction
		Velocity - Speed with direction

Scalar - has only direction, An single number
Vector - list of numbers, either a row or column
Matrix - array of numbers.


Vector forms:
	1. Polar form: which is represented with angle(theta) - Example: a Vector A at 30 degree
	2. Cartesian form: which is represented with x and y, Example: a vector A of (x, y)


Products : 1. Dot Product a . b = |a||b|cos theta 
	   2. Cross Product a x b = |a||b| sin theta


Cosine Similarity = np.dot(a,b) / (norm(a) * norm(b))
		    nn.CosineSimilarity(dim=0, eps=1e-6)

Dot Product = Conditions : 1. 1st matrix column and 2nd matrix row should be same.

				Example: A =[1,2,3         B = [2,3,4            Here 3 is matching and o/p will be in shape 2x3
					     4,5,6] = 2x3       5,6,7
                                                                9,8,2] = 3x3 


norm = sqrt(sum(elements^2))

Cosine distance = 1 - CosineSimilarity


Vector Addition:
 		- Just adds the elements


Cross Product = xi+ yj + zk


Vector Dot Product (np.vdot): The dot product of the 2 vector is a scalar value , since vector have either 1 row of values or 1 columns of value.

example : 	x1 = np.random.rand(10,1) -rand - Used to generate random numbers between 0-1 .
		x2 = np.random.randn(10)   randn - Used to generate random numbers between -1-1.
		z = vdot(x1,x2) , So here the value of z will be a scalar value.


Vecdot(np.vecdot) - gives the vector dot product of 2 arrays

Matrix_norm - Finds the norm of an matrix
			- takes the whole matrix and adds the square of each number in the matrix and take the square root of the matrix.


Vector norm - Used to compute the norm of an vector.
