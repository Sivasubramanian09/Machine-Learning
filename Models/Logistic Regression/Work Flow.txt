Work Flow for Logistic Regression:

Step1 - Set Learning Rate & Number of Iterations; Initiate Random weight and bias value

Step2 - Build Logistic Regression Function(sigmoid Function)

Step3 - Update the parameters using gradient Descent

Finally we will get the best model(best weight and bias value) as it has minimum cost function

Step4 - Build the "Predict" function to determine the class of the data point.
