Task - Take the code from the reference provided and do train/test/validate and find the accuracy and then do data augmentation by adding gaussian noise and find the accuracy for that data and compare both.

Dataset - Diabetes.csv (used to predict whether the patient have chance of getting diabetes or not)

Model - Simple ANN

Algorithm:
	1.Import all the libraries required
	2.Load the dataset using pd.read_csv or np.loadtxt
	3.Split the data to input features and output feature
	4.Convert the data to Tensor using torch.tensor
	5.Split the dataset into training , testing and validating using train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection
	6.Create a simple NN with torch by Creating class or using nn.Sequential
	7.Call the model
	8.Define the optimizers and loss function (BCEloss and Adam optimizer)
	9.Train the model with train data:
		1.using batch and train the model
		2.Forward_pass
		3.Find the loss
		4.Do backward_pass
		5.Update the parameters
		6.Sum the loss for every batch , i . e, trainloss += loss.item()  
		7.Find the average loss by dividing the trainloss by no.of batches(len(data)/batch_size)
		8.Do the same proces for Validation with torch.no_grad()
	10.Plot the graph
	11.Find the accuracy
	12.Augment the data by adding gausian noise using mean and standard deviation
	13.Repeat the step 9 with augmented data
	14.Plot the graph
	15.Find the accuracy
	16.Compare the accuracy.
